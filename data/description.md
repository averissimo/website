I am a PhD student at the [Systems Engineering in Life Sciences](http://sels.tecnico.pt) in [IDMEC](http://idmec.ist.utl.pt) Centre of Intelligent Systems (Lisbon, Portugal) and at the [Erable team](https://team.inria.fr/erable/en/) in INRIA (Lyon, France). I am interested in applying modeling and machine learning techniques to biological problems. My research mostly focus on Systems Biology, with emphasis in engineering applications to the life sciences.

I am also driven to create collaborative solutions to facilitate communications between team members and across areas. [BGFit](http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/bgfit) is a great example and I look forward to continue my research and create real-world applications that are used by people and are an asset when solving problems.

I was awarded a PhD Grant for 4 years by [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/index.phtml.en) to research machine learning tecniques in [Cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer), [Sepsis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis) and [HIV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV) at University of Lisbon and the Universit√© Claude Bernard - Lyon 1 - *(SFRH/BD/97415/2013)*.
