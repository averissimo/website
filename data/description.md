I was a PhD student at the [Systems Engineering in Life Sciences](http://sels.tecnico.pt) in [INESC-ID](https://inesc-id.pt) _(Lisbon, Portugal)_ and at the [Erable team](https://team.inria.fr/erable/en/) in INRIA _(Lyon, France)_. I am interested in applying modeling and machine learning techniques to biological problems. My research mostly focus on Systems Biology, with emphasis in engineering applications to the life sciences.

The core of my research work was to create new models that use known biological networks to better predict the outcome of cancer patients.

I am also driven to create collaborative solutions to facilitate communications between team members and across areas. [BGFit](http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/bgfit) is a great example and I look forward to continue my research and create real-world applications that are used by people and are an asset when solving problems.

I was awarded a PhD Grant by [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/index.phtml.en) to research machine learning tecniques in [Cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer), [Sepsis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis) and [HIV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV) at University of Lisbon and the Universit√© Claude Bernard - Lyon 1 - *(SFRH/BD/97415/2013)*.
